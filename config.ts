    I am Elikem Ameshie, commonly referred to as Eli. I have always had a passion for technology and started typing on a keyboard at a young age. During that time, I created Java Plugins and Scripts for my Minecraft server.\n\n
    My journey took a significant step about four years ago when I established a freelancing agency focused on developing websites for local businesses using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Witnessing the joy these websites brought to people and realizing that I could positively impact someone's life with something I both enjoyed and created, solidified my decision to pursue a career as a software engineer. 
    Transitioning from being self-taught to entering college and gaining a more theoretical and design-oriented understanding of computer science allowed me to evolve as a developer and refine my development process. These are some of the tools and technologies I love to use and work with.
